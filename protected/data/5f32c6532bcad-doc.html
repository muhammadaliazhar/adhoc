Top Menu Explanation</h1>
</div>
At the top of Sydney, you will see the menu bar with the different page drop downs. Most pages will lead to a grid view screen where you can access and search for different records.<br />
 <br /><br />
 
<h2>Grid View</h2>
Sellers, Contacts, Buyers, Actions, Listing, Search Listings, Deals, Inquiries, Reports and more will all lead to the grid view when you select them from the menu bar. The grid view is where you can search and access the records. You will only be able to see the records that you own from these pages (office owners will see their entire office’s records).<br />
 <br /><br />
 <br />
 <br />
Search for a record in the grid view by typing in the search bar of that column.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br /><br clear="all" />
 <br />
Each grid view can be customized by choosing different columns. Click the <strong>Columns </strong>button and check the field you would like to add. Click on the name of any column to organize the list from ascending to descending.<br />
 <br />
 <br /><br />
 <br />
